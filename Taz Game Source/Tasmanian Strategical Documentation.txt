 NOTICE! Tasmanian S. REQUIRES a fossil driver to operate::

 Included in this version of Tasmanian Strategical is the fossil driver BNU.
 This must either be installed as a DEVICE in CONFIG.SYS (BNU.SYS) or run in
 your AUTOEXEC.BAT (BNU.COM) or else your system may crash or simply not work.

 If problems develop with your fossil driver use X00 (instructions for X00
 are included in this manual)

 *****

 FOSSIL Does NOT apply to SYNCHRONET VERSION!!!

 (Make sure you have the Synchronet Version, and not the Standard Version.
  The Synchronet version will allow you to use the Synchronet command
  keys from inside the game!!! BE WARNED!)

NOTE: BNU is copyright and property of it's respective holder(s).

[INSTALL.DOC]


    I N S T A L L A T I O N . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

    1) Unzip Tasmanian Strategical into it's own directory

    2) Run INSTALL.EXE

    3) INSTALL will first prompt you to print this documentation.

    4) INSTALL will then go to the 'Install Program' menu:

       a) Your source directory is the directory INSTALL reads the
	  archive files FROM.

       b) Your target is where the program writes TO. It's always best if
	  you use the same source and target.

       c) Select 'Proceed...'

    5) Install will then go to the 'Reconfigure Program' menu:

       a) Enter BBS Directory (Bulleting Board System Dir)

       b) A Drop File is a file created by the BBS so that onliners can
	  read the user's information. Here are some standard files:

	  DOOR.SYS     - Synchronet, Gap, Apex, Remote Acc., WC3.0, PCBoard
	  CHAIN.TXT    - WWiV, Apex, Telegard
	  DORINFO*.DEF - QBBS, RBBS, Telegard
	  SFDOORS.DAT  - Spitfire, TriTel, Telegard
	  CALLINFO.BBS - Wilcat A & B, Telegard

       c) INSTALL will write a batch file to the specified directory & name

       d) Select lanuguage default (English or French)

       e) Select cursor default (Yes or No)

       f) Select 'Proceed...'

    6) INSTALL will then go to the 'Initiate New Game' menu:

       a) Turns / Cycle determines how many 'turns' a player get per day

       b) Turns / Immunity determines how long a player has 'attack immunity'
	  If you set this TOO high the game will get monotonous and boring.
	  Ten to Twenty turns are acceptable, but this is also dependent on
	  how many turns per day players have.

       c) Cycle Length & Commence Dates are not used in this version.

       e) Select 'Proceed...'


[CONTINUED...]

[CONTINUATION...]


    7) Select 'Initialize New Game' whenever you want to start a new game
       (Only one game can be running at a time, of course)

    8) INSTALL will return to the Main Menu

    9) Select 'Proceed...' to exit INSTALL

   10) Now, you have to go into the external program configuration for your
       bulletin board system and enter in all the information provided on the
       previous page (above) as applicable.

   11) Now you will have to install a fossil driver into memory everytime
       you start up your computer so that Tasmanian Strategical can function
       (Does not include SYNCHRONET VERSION)

   12) Find a place that carries a fossil driver and download it. Unzip
       the files either into the T.S. directory or into it's own dir.
       BNU is already included with this package for you convenience.

   13) Choose from one of the four below options

	  DEFAULT:::
       1) If you **DO NOT** have a fossil driver already installed AND
	  want to have TAZBAT.BAT run your fossil by default go directly
	  to step 18.

	  ALTERNATIVES:
       2) If you **DO** have a working fossil driver installed in your system:
	  do step 14 and 15, then go to step 18.

       3) If you **DO NOT** have a fossil driver already installed
	  AND want to install a fossil driver to your AUTOEXEC.SYS
	  do step 16, then go to step 18.

       4) If you **DO NOT** have a fossil driver already installed
	  AND want to install a fossil driver to your CONFIG.SYS
	  do step 17, then go to step 18.

   14) Edit your TAZBAT.BAT file as necessary:
       (The first two lines are not necessary for Synchronet.)

 cd\bbs\taz                     Goto Tasmanian Strategical Dir
 copy \bbs\chain.txt            Copy User Information File From BBS
 bnu                            Run included fossil driver

 Taz %1 %2 %3  <--------- This is where you add additional nodes for your
			  BBS. For example, if you are running a 5 node
			  BBS the line would read 'TAZ %1 %2 %3 %4 %5'
			  I think you get the Drift.

 cd\bbs                         Return to System


[CONTINUED...]

[CONTINUATION...]


   15) If you already have a fossil driver installed, REMOVE the line
       in your 'TAZBAT.BAT' file that runs 'BNU' with an ASCII text editor

   16) Install the fossil driver in your AUTOEXEC.BAT like so:
	      ...
	      PATH = C:\path;C:\path;...;C:\BNU; <--- Add FOSSIL DRIVER path
	      ...
	      BNU                               -- Choice #2 -- BNU Fossil
	      ...

   17) Install the fossil driver in your CONFIG.SYS like so:
	      ...
	      DEVICE=C:\FOSSIL\BNU.SYS     -- Choice #2 -- BNU Fossil
	      ...

   18) Now go into your BBS Onliner/External Program editor and enter in
       all applicable information:

    Name                        Tasmanian Strategical

  The following instructions are for the installation of X00 ONLY as an
  alternative to the BNU FOSSIL DRIVER. (Written by Kevin 'Viroman' Ross)

***** ***** ***** ***** *****
  USE 'X00' IN PLACE OF 'BNU' IF ANY PROBLEMS DEVELOP.
***** ***** ***** ***** *****

 Find a place that carries the fossil driver and Download it. Create a
 directory on your hard drive and label it XOO.  Ok, now copy the zip file
 into the directory and Unzip it.  No here comes the fun part, edit
 your AUTOEXEC.BAT and do the following:

---> AUTOEXEC.BAT (Example) :

PROMPT $p$g
PATH = C:\DOS;C:\SBBS;C:\QEMM;C:\XOO; <--- Add XOO to path
SET TEMP=C:\DOS
XU DV:ON           <----- Add this...
XU PORT:0:ON       <----- Add this line it turns on the Fossil driver for
			  Port 0 (Which is COM 1 <--- ATTENTION!!).
XU Set:0:19200:8N1 <----- This Command line sets the port
			  FORMAT ---> XU SET:A:XXXXX:PNS
			  A     Stands for which XOO port number
			  XXXXX Stands for the baud rate (Speed of your modem)
			  PNS   Stands for parity et al. (Use 8N1 as default)

To calculate the PORT NUMBER, take your COM PORT NUMBER and subject ONE from
that, Thus ---> COM 5 is Fossil PORT 4, etc.. (Refer below for more info..)

  Port 0 is: Com 1          Port 4 is: Com 5
  Port 1     Com 2          Port 5     Com 6
  Port 2     Com 3          Port 6     Com 7
  Port 3     Com 4          Port 7     Com 8

---> CONFIG.SYS (Add the following line ALSO) :

DEVICE=C:\XOO\X00.SYS E 0=3f8,IRQ4 <----- Now this is Self-Expl., but...
					  '0'  is the Fossil Port number
					  3f8  is the Address Port for COM 1
					  IRQ4 is the IRQ port for COM 1

  Port  ADDR  IRQ           Port  ADDR  IRQ  <----- This is a listing of all
  COM1  3f8   IRQ4          COM3  3e8   IRQ5        standard COM Port w/
  COM2  2f8   IRQ3          COM4  2e8   IRQ3        Address Port and IRQs

Once you add those lines reset you machine and away you go the Drivers load
and you are now in the great world of Fossil Drivers!!!

NOTE: BNU and X00 are both property of their respective holder(s).
