Notes from October 11, 2019:

This program was originally compiled using Borland Turbo C++ 2.0.

In order to re-compile this program, you will need to:
1) Interpret the "Project File" to determine which files need to be included in your project.
2) Make sure you include the OpenDoors library.
   It may require some work in order to figure out how to make this work on a modern compiler.
3) Some functions such as those provided in conio.h may not exist in all modern compilers.
